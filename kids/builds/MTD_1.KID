When the Patient's TRACKING STATUS is:
"KRN",8994,4004,1,9,0)
 
"KRN",8994,4004,1,10,0)
0   NO = No, the patient is not being tracked.
"KRN",8994,4004,1,11,0)
When the patient's tracking status is NO and a tracking entry of START is 
"KRN",8994,4004,1,12,0)
created the patients status will become YES.
"KRN",8994,4004,1,13,0)
Likewise, if a tracking entry of FLAG were to be created the patients 
"KRN",8994,4004,1,14,0)
tracking status would become FLAG.
"KRN",8994,4004,1,15,0)
Additionally, but not necessary, if an entry of STOP was created the 
"KRN",8994,4004,1,16,0)
tracking status would be set to NO.
"KRN",8994,4004,1,17,0)
 
"KRN",8994,4004,1,18,0)
1  YES = Yes, the patient is being tracked.
"KRN",8994,4004,1,19,0)
When the patients tracking status is YES a tracking entry of NO will 
"KRN",8994,4004,1,20,0)
change their status to NO. FLAG entries do not change the status of the 
"KRN",8994,4004,1,21,0)
patient when their status is YES; however, if a FLAG entry where to be 
"KRN",8994,4004,1,22,0)
rejected it would change the status of the patient to NO.
"KRN",8994,4004,1,23,0)
 
"KRN",8994,4004,1,24,0)
2  FLAG = Please review, this patient may need to be tracked.
"KRN",8994,4004,1,25,0)
If a patient is set as FLAG then a tracking entry of ACCEPT will YES 
"KRN",8994,4004,1,26,0)
their status while a REJECT will NO their status.
"KRN",8994,4004,1,27,0)
Likewise, but not necessary, an entry of START or STOP will change their
