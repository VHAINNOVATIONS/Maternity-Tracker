This cross-reference is used to group findings for evaluation. It
"IX",811.9,811.902,"AENODE",.1,2,0)
creates two indexes, the first one has the form:
"IX",811.9,811.902,"AENODE",.1,3,0)

"IX",811.9,811.902,"AENODE",.1,4,0)
 ^PXD(811.9,DA(1),20,"E",GLOBAL,IEN,DA)
"IX",811.9,811.902,"AENODE",.1,5,0)
 where 
"IX",811.9,811.902,"AENODE",.1,6,0)
  DA(1) is the internal entry number in file # 811.9.
"IX",811.9,811.902,"AENODE",.1,7,0)
  GLOBAL is the global name of the global that defines the finding.
"IX",811.9,811.902,"AENODE",.1,8,0)
   For example, the global name for file #811.9 is ^PXD(811.9,.
"IX",811.9,811.902,"AENODE",.1,9,0)
  IEN is the internal entry number of the finding in GLOBAL.
"IX",811.9,811.902,"AENODE",.1,10,0)
  DA is the finding number.

finding is labeled by an integer: the FUNCTION FINDING NUMBER. The
"^DD",811.9,811.9,25,21,3,0)
user defines a function finding by inputting a FUNCTION FINDING
"^DD",811.9,811.9,25,21,4,0)

"^DD",811.9,811.9,25,21,5,0)
used in the reminder definition logic by reference to FF(FUNCTION
"^DD",811.9,811.9,25,21,6,0)
FINDING NUMBER). For example, if function findings 1 and 2 were
"^DD",811.9,811.9,25,21,7,0)
defined, then they could be used in the cohort or resolution logic as

The default behavior is to use only the most recent health factor
"^DD",811.9,811.902,11,21,7,0)
within a category. A problem can arise if there are two or more
"^DD",811.9,811.902,11,21,8,0)
health factors within a category and they both have the same date.
"^DD",811.9,811.902,11,21,9,0)
(This can happen if both health factors are given during the same
"^DD",811.9,811.902,11,21,10,0)
encounter).  When the dates are the same, the health factor with the
"^DD",811.9,811.902,11,21,11,0)
highest WITHIN CATEGORY RANK will be used. This is a numerical value
"^DD",811.9,811.902,11,21,12,0)

This is the ending date/time to search for findings. When combined
"^DD",811.9,811.902,12,21,2,0)
with the BEGINNING DATE/TIME they define a date range in which to
"^DD",811.9,811.902,12,21,3,0)
search for the finding. The ENDING DATE/TIME must be after the

In addition, you can use the abbreviations T-NY or NOW-NY,where N is

"^DD",811.9,811.902,12,21,14,0)
example, FIEVAL(M,"DATE")+3M would set the Ending Date/Time to the

The CONDITION must be written in M code based on the value returned from
"^DD",811.9,811.902,14,21,2,0)
the patient results for the finding. Each type of finding has a specific
"^DD",811.9,811.902,14,21,3,0)
field that provides the value available to use in the CONDITION logic.
"^DD",811.9,811.902,14,21,4,0)
If the finding value is text, enclose the condition value in quotes 
"^DD",811.9,811.902,14,21,5,0)
(e.g., "positive"). If the finding value is numeric, do not use quotes
"^DD",811.9,811.902,14,21,6,0)

An IF statement is used to evaluate the value.  The value is always
"^DD",811.9,811.902,14,21,9,0)
identified as V in the statement regardless of the type of finding. If 
"^DD",811.9,811.902,14,21,10,0)
the condition logic statement evaluates to true, the finding is 
"^DD",811.9,811.902,14,21,11,0)
considered as found (true); otherwise the finding is considered as not

When none of the standard Clinical Reminder finding types will work, a
"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",2,0)
computed finding can be created. There are two steps in creating a
"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",3,0)
computed finding. First a MUMPS routine must be written. Information
"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",4,0)
about how to do this can be found in the Clinical Reminders Manager
"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",5,0)
Manual. The second step is to make an entry in this file, which
"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",6,0)
contains a list of reminder computed findings. There are four fields
"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",7,0)
for each entry; they are:
"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",8,0)
 
"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",9,0)
NAME - this is the name of the computed finding. When adding a computed
"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",10,0)
finding as finding to a reminder definition or term, it is done using
"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",11,0)
the name. For example, you would type CF.VA-BMI to add the exported
"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",12,0)
VA-BMI computed finding to your reminder definition.
"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",13,0)
 
"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",14,0)
ROUTINE - this is the name of the MUMPS routine.
"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",15,0)
 
"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",16,0)
ENTRY - this is the entry point in the MUMPS routine.
"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",17,0)
 
"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",18,0)
PRINT NAME - this will be displayed on the Clinical Maintenance
"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",19,0)
component as the name of the computed finding. If it is blank, then NAME
"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",20,0)
will be used.
"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",21,0)

"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",22,0)
TYPE - this is a set of codes that specifies what type of computed
"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",23,0)
finding this is. "S" stands for single occurrence, "M" for multiple occurrence,
"^DIC",811.4,811.4,"%D",24,0)
and "L" for list. If it is blank, single will be assumed.
