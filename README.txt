 CPRS: Maternity Tracker applies some modifications to capture discreet data
       from Reminder Dialogs. This functionality is also part of oCNTs and can be
       used by the MCC Dashboard or any GUI for that matter. For more information
       see DSIO_DDCS.pdf (Discreet Data Control and Storage). The only other
       change submitted was to allow the passing of TIU XML Data2 block by CPRS
       through the COM as a shared template; it currently only works when it is
       linked directly to the title.
	   
 oCNT: Open Source Custom Note Template. This program uses the TIU COM
       functionality to aid the user in creating a TIU Document. For more
       information see DSIO_oCNT.pdf.
	   
 CORE: These are the new and modified M Components to VistA that make up the
       core of Maternity Tracker. Please see DSIO_CORE.pdf for more information.
