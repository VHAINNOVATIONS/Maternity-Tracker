Maternity-Tracker
=================
The Maternity Tracker project is a collection of changes to existing programs
such as CPRS and SMART and new programs such as oCNT and the MCC Dashboard.

The VistA namespace for Maternity tracker is: DSIO
           The VistA numberspace for DSIO is: 19641

SMART: This is an independent project. Maternity Tracker fixes some bugs and
       extends the SMART Alerts to utilize the TIU ComObject functionality. Some
	   of these changes are modifications to CPRS. For more information see
	   DSIO_SMART.pdf.
	   
 CPRS: Maternity Tracker applies some modifications to capture discreet data
       from Reminder Dialogs. These functionality is also part of oCNTs. For
	   more information see DSIO_DDCS.pdf (Discreet Data Control and Storage).
	   To see changes see DSIO_CPRS.pdf.
	   
 oCNT: Open Source Custom Note Template. This program uses the TIU ComObject
       functionality to aid the user in creating a TIU Document. For more
	   information see DSIO_oCNT.pdf.
	   
 CORE: These are the new and modified M Components to VistA that make up the
       core of Maternity Tracker. Please see DSIO_CORE.pdf for more information.
