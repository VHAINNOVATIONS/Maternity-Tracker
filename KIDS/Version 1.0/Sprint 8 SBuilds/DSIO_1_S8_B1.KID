There are advantages and disadvantages in splitting a document up into
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.04,21,54,0)
separate components (rather than writing sections into the Boilerplate
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.04,21,55,0)
Text of the Title): Since Components are stored as separate file entries,
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.04,21,56,0)
they are inherently accessable and even 'moveable'. Using Fileman, sites
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.04,21,57,0)
can access components of documents the same way they can access documents
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.04,21,58,0)
for reports, etc.. Also, in the future, TIU may have options to move/copy
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.04,21,59,0)
certain components from one document into another.  The disadvantage is
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.04,21,60,0)
speed: Components make the structure more complex and therefore slow down

O OBJECT: Objects are names which may be embedded in the predefined
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.04,21,64,0)

"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.04,21,65,0)
into the boilerplate text of a Title, enclosed by '|'s.  For example,
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.04,21,66,0)

"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.04,21,69,0)
 
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.04,21,70,0)
Then a user who enters such a note for a patient known by the system to be
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.04,21,71,0)
56 years old would be presented with the text:
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.04,21,72,0)

"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.04,21,74,0)
 
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.04,21,75,0)
The user can then add to the text and or edit the text, including the age
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.04,21,76,0)
(56) of the patient.  From this point on, the patient age (56) is regular

NOTE on Availability of Titles for entering documents: 
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,33,0)
Although Status affects availability for entering documents, there are
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,34,0)
other factors which also affect availability: A Document Definition is not
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,35,0)
available to a given user for entering documents (excepting the Document
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,36,0)
Definition Utility Try Action) unless all of the following 3 criteria are
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,37,0)
met:
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,38,0)
 
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,39,0)
  1) It is a Document Definition of Type Title.
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,40,0)
 
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,41,0)
  2) It has Status Active or Test.  If it has Status Test, the user
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,42,0)
entering a document must own the Title.
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,43,0)
 
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,44,0)
  3) If authorization for using the Title to enter documents is restricted
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,45,0)
by Business Rules, the user must be a member of the authorized user
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,46,0)
class.
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,47,0)
 
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,48,0)
Unless these criteria are all met, users trying to enter documents will
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,49,0)
not SEE the Document Definition.  Therefore it is wise to warn users when
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,50,0)
taking definitions offline for edit, and/or to do so at nonpeak hours for
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,51,0)

The above description applies to document entry BOTH manually through

menu options AND via upload.  It does NOT apply to autoentry of documents
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,55,0)
via the TIU application interface.  Adverse Reaction/Allergy notes entered
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,56,0)

"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,57,0)

When being upgraded to Status Active or Test, a Title is examined for

rudimentary completeness and must be judged OK before the upgrade takes
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,63,0)
place.  If desired, users can perform the same examination themselves by
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,64,0)
selecting action TRY.  For Titles, Action TRY also permits the user to
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,65,0)
enter a document on the entry.  The document is deleted immediately after

Availability for entering documents is the central meaning of Status.
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,69,0)
However, Status also controls edit/deletion of Document Definitions:  A
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,70,0)
Title can be edited ONLY if it has Status Inactive, ensuring that no one
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,71,0)
is using it to enter a document while its behavior is changing.  Titles
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,72,0)
can be deleted only with Status Inactive.
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,73,0)
 
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,74,0)
NOTE: Although Status affects Editing ability, it is not the only factor
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,75,0)
affecting editing:  If an entry is already IN USE by documents,
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,76,0)
editing/deletion is restricted to aspects which will not harm existing
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,77,0)

"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,79,0)
Components under a Title have the same status as the Title: When a Title's
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,80,0)
status is changed, the statuses of its descendant Components are
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,81,0)

Basics for a Class or Document Class cannot be edited (except for Owner
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,90,0)
and Status) unless it is Inactive.  Since Inactivating a Class/Document
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,91,0)
Class automatically inactivates its descendants, this ensures that all
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,92,0)
Titles which inherit behavior from it are neither Active nor Test, and are
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,93,0)

In contrast to Basics, the ability to add/edit ITEMS of a Class/Document
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,96,0)
Class depends on the Status of the item, not the parent: it is NOT
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,97,0)
necessary to Inactivate a Class such as Progress Notes in order to

Its status can be changed only by changing the Status of its Parent, if it
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,110,0)

"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,112,0)
NOTE: The above implies that Test or Active Titles cannot have Inactive
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,113,0)
Components.  In other words, Inactivating a Component is NOT a way of
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,114,0)
retiring it.  If a Component is no longer a useful section of a Title, it
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,115,0)
should be edited so as to make it useful, or it should be deleted AS AN
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,116,0)
ITEM from the Title of which it is a part.  As with all retired Document
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,117,0)

"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,118,0)

They DO NOT HAVE A STATUS. They can be edited only when all parent Titles

"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.07,21,127,0)
ensures that all parent Titles of Shared Components are offline while the

When an item under a non-orphan is deleted as an item, it becomes an
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.11,21,37,0)
orphan along with all of its descendants.  TIUF, the Document Definition
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.11,21,38,0)
Utility, does not permit non-orphan Titles to become orphaned if they are
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.11,21,39,0)
In Use.  Titles already used but being retired from further use should
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.11,21,40,0)
be Inactivated, NOT orphaned.  Components are a different story;
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.11,21,41,0)
components being retired from further use can and should be orphaned
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.11,21,42,0)

ancestry in order to process existing documents.  Since components, on the
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.11,21,46,0)

"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.11,21,47,0)

Some Document Definitions, for example, CWAD's, are developed nationally

and sent out as standardized entries across the nation.  TIU and other
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.13,21,3,0)

"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.13,21,5,0)
 
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.13,21,6,0)

In two cases, sites are permitted to edit National Standard entries.  The

first case concerns Titles.  Sites can edit Status and Abbreviation for
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.13,21,11,0)
National Titles.  Status INACTIVE for a National Title prevents manual and
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.13,21,12,0)
upload entry of documents for the Title, while continuing to permit
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.13,21,13,0)
automatic entry for the Title via the TIU application interface for new
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.13,21,14,0)
notes. (Example: Adverse Reaction/Allergy notes are automatically
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.13,21,15,0)

"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,.13,21,16,0)
of grouping national titles with other National and non-National Titles as

header 'Progress Notes', Field Print Form Number holds Form Number 'Vice
"^DD",8925.1,8925.1,6.14,21,23,0)

The Document Definition file contains extensive, detailed field
"^DIC",8925.1,8925.1,"%D",49,0)
descriptions. Likewise, some protocols (File 101) used in TIU have
"^DIC",8925.1,8925.1,"%D",50,0)
extensive and careful descriptions in the Protocol file. Many of these
"^DIC",8925.1,8925.1,"%D",51,0)
descriptions are used in TIU for online help. If it becomes necessary for
"^DIC",8925.1,8925.1,"%D",52,0)
a national programmer to edit these descriptions, the programmer should
"^DIC",8925.1,8925.1,"%D",53,0)
check to make sure all online help is still displayed properly.

Users are expected to use the Document Definition Utility TIUF to enter,
"^DIC",8925.1,8925.1,"%D",56,0)
edit, and delete file entries.  In fact, the file prohibits the deletion
"^DIC",8925.1,8925.1,"%D",57,0)
of entries through generic Fileman Options.  It also prohibits the edit
"^DIC",8925.1,8925.1,"%D",58,0)
through generic Fileman of a few critical fields: Type, Status, Shared,
"^DIC",8925.1,8925.1,"%D",59,0)
and National Standard.  Adding and Deleting (but not editing) Items is
"^DIC",8925.1,8925.1,"%D",60,0)
also prohibited through generic Fileman options.  Abbreviation and Print

This does NOT imply that it is SAFE to use generic Fileman to edit other
"^DIC",8925.1,8925.1,"%D",64,0)
fields.  Users are cautioned that edit through generic Fileman bypasses
"^DIC",8925.1,8925.1,"%D",65,0)
many safeguards built in to the Document Definition Utility and can create
"^DIC",8925.1,8925.1,"%D",66,0)
havoc unless the user THOROUGHLY UNDERSTANDS the File and its uses.
