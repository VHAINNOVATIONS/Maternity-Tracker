"KRN",8994,4004,1,10,0)
0   NO = No, the patient is not being tracked.
"KRN",8994,4004,1,11,0)
When the patient's tracking status is NO and a tracking entry of START is 
"KRN",8994,4004,1,12,0)
created the patients status will become YES.
"KRN",8994,4004,1,13,0)
Likewise, if a tracking entry of FLAG were to be created the patients 
"KRN",8994,4004,1,14,0)
tracking status would become FLAG.
"KRN",8994,4004,1,15,0)
Additionally, but not necessary, if an entry of STOP was created the 
"KRN",8994,4004,1,16,0)

When the patients tracking status is YES a tracking entry of NO will

change their status to NO. FLAG entries do not change the status of the 
"KRN",8994,4004,1,21,0)

"KRN",8994,4004,1,22,0)
