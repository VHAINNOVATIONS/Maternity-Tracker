DDCS FORMS (Delphi XE10)
========================
To install the DDCSFramework from source load the project DDCSFramework.dproj and then in the project manager you can right click the package name "DDCSFramework.bpl" and select install.

To load from DDCSFramework.bpl you can select the "Component" option "Install Packages" then select ADD and navigate to the .bpl and open.

Be sure to add the DDCSForm directory to your Library. Do this by going to "Tools" "Options" and under "Delphi Options" select "Library". Once here go to "Library path" and add the full path (including DDCSForm) by using the "..." button to the right, then the folder icon to select the path and "Add".

You should now have the category "DDCSForm" in your tool palette with TDDCSForm as an entry.

Creating a DDCS Form (as a CPRS Note Extension) DLL
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. In Delphi (XE10) create a New Project - Delphi Projects - Dynamic-link Library.

2. Right click the project name (Project1.dll) from the project manager and select "Add New" - "VCL Form". I changed the name of the form unit to frmMain. The source should now look like this...

	```Pascal
	library Project1;

	{ Important note about DLL memory management: ShareMem must be the
	  first unit in your library's USES clause AND your project's (select
	  Project-View Source) USES clause if your DLL exports any procedures or
	  functions that pass strings as parameters or function results. This
	  applies to all strings passed to and from your DLL--even those that
	  are nested in records and classes. ShareMem is the interface unit to
	  the BORLNDMM.DLL shared memory manager, which must be deployed along
	  with your DLL. To avoid using BORLNDMM.DLL, pass string information
	  using PChar or ShortString parameters. }

	uses
	  System.SysUtils,
	  System.Classes,
	  frmMain in 'frmMain.pas' {Form1};

	{$R *.res}

	begin
	end.
	```

3. In your VCL Form unit go to your tool pallet and look for TDDCSForm (it's in the DDCSForm category) and add it to your form. Make sure you add at least one page (right click the body of the component and select "New Page") before you add anything else. All components must be placed on a page in order to be picked up by DDCS.

4. Now lets go back to the source and make it look like the following...

	```Pascal
	library Project1;

	{$R *.dres}

	uses
	  Winapi.Windows,
	  Vcl.Forms,
	  uExtndComBroker,
	  frmMain in 'frmMain.pas' {Form1};

	{$R *.res}

	function Launch(const CPRSBroker: PCPRSComBroker; out Return: WideString): WordBool; stdcall;
	var
	  oldHandle: HWND;
	begin
	  Result := False;

	  oldHandle := Application.Handle;
	  Application.Handle := GetActiveWindow;

	  RPCBrokerV := CPRSBroker^;
	  Form1 := TForm1.Create(nil);
	  try
		RPCBrokerV.DisabledWindow := DisableTaskWindows(0);
		Form1.ShowModal;
		if Form1.DDCSForm1.Validated then
		begin
		  Result := True;
		  Return := Form1.DDCSForm1.TmpStrList.Text;
		end;
	  finally
		Form1.Free;
		RPCBrokerV := nil;
		Application.Handle := oldHandle;
	  end;
	end;

	exports
	  Launch;

	begin
	end.
	```

Adding Themes
------------------
Add the Windows10 theme to your project. This step is optional and at the time of this writing the component's option to change the theme was disabled but if you wish to use it your project will also have to have the appropriate themes added as a resource.

Select the "Project" option and under it select "Resources and Images...". Then select "Add..." and navigate to the theme .vsf file resource you wish to add (mine were located at C:\Users\Public\Documents\Embarcadero\Studio\17.0\Styles\). Once added, set the type to VCLSTYLE and set the identifier to Resource_1 for the first one and just incrememt the number for each additional entry.

![Resource Theme](https://github.com/VHAINNOVATIONS/Maternity-Tracker/tree/master/Documentation/readme_images/Resource_Theme.png)

Adding Components to the Form
--------------------------------------
Now that we have the base form built we'll want to add some components to it - make sure to add components only to a TDDCSForm TTabSheet.

**Supported Components are those that inherit from...**

 - TORDateBox
 - TORCheckBox
 - TORComboBox
 - TORListBox
 - TORListView
 - TStaticText
 - TDateTimePicker
 - TCustomMemo
 - TCustomEdit
 - TCheckBox
 - TRadioButton
 - TRadioGroup
 - TCustomCombo
 - TCustomListBox
 - TListView
 - TStringGrid

**Form with Components**

![Form with Components](https://github.com/VHAINNOVATIONS/Maternity-Tracker/tree/master/Documentation/Form_Components.png)

When you add a component to the TabSheet it will be added to your DDCSForm ReportCollection (the ReportCollection is used to build the note).

**ReportCollection**

![ReportCollection](https://github.com/VHAINNOVATIONS/Maternity-Tracker/tree/master/Documentation/ReportCollection.png)

For the ReportItem for your newly added component you can set the following fields and this is what they do/are for.

**DialogReturn**<br/>
When the component is set up to list Dialogs (forms stored in the DDCSDialogs.dll) the return of the dialog must be stored in another component that's inherited from a TCustomMemo.

**DoNotRestoreV**<br/>
This value must be updated to VistA in order for it to be acted on. When the VistA configuration record is updated each time the form is created it will not recall any previously saved information other than configuration values.

**DoNotSave**<br/>
At the GUI level this component will not send any information back to VistA.

**DoNotSpace**<br/>
For the generation of the note there will not be a space added to the output of this component.

**HideFromNote**<br/>
This component will not output to the note.

**IdentifyingName**<br/>
If validation fails (if this component is required but not valued) then this is the name that is displayed to the user.

**Order**<br/>
When the note is generated the note is built as a list of components and it is done so in this order. In order to change the order use the up and down arrows within in the ReportCollection in the project structure.

**OwningObject**<br/>
This is the component that this ReportItem extends.

**Prefix**<br/>
When generating the note this value is printed before the component value. If the component inherits from a TCustomMemo each line will be prefixed.

**Required**<br/>
If TRUE then when the user Finishes the form this component must be valued.

**SayOnFocus**<br/>
This is the string that JAWS will say when the component gains focus before carrying on with any of its defaulted behavior.

**Suffix**<br/>
When generating a note this value is print after the component value. If the component inherits from TCustomMemo each line will be suffixed.

**Title**<br/>
When generating the note this string will be printed above the component value.

Form Properties
-------------------
The TDDCSForm inherits from TPageControl so anything you can do with a PageControl you can also do with a DDCS form with the addition to the following...

However, do **NOT** change the following properties...

Property   |  Value
---------- | -----------
Align      |  alClient
TabStop    |  False
TabOrder   |  0
MultiLine  |  tsButtons
Style      |  tpTop
OwnerDraw  |  True

And do **NOT** set the following methods...

**OnDrawTab** = DrawCheckTab

---


**Published Properties**

---

**AutoTimer**<br/>
If you wish to override the existing timer that handles the auto save of ReportItems to VistA then you can select a new TTimer.

**DisableSplash**<br/>
When the form is displayed a splash screen is shown, if this is TRUE then it will not be shown.

**ReportCollection**<br/>
This is the form's collection of components that will be reported on. Only this components will be checked for validity (if marked as TRUE for the required filed) and will be added to the generated note. Furthermore, only these components are saved to VistA as discreet data.

```Pascal
procedure DeleteNoteItem(Value: TWinControl);
```
Pass in the component to delete the ReportItem.

```Pascal
function GetNoteItemAddifNil(Value: TWinControl): TDDCSNoteItem;
```
Pass in the component to return the ReportItem and if it doesn't exist
then it will create it and return it.

```Pascal
function GetNoteItem(Value: TWinControl): TDDCSNoteItem;
```
Pass in the component to return the ReportItem or nil if it doesn't exist.

```Pascal
function GetAControl(Value: string): TWinControl;
```
Pass in the name of the component to return that component.

```Pascal
function Add: TDDCSNoteItem; overload;
```
Don't use this.

```Pascal
function Insert**(Index: Integer): TDDCSNoteItem;
```
Don't use this.

```Pascal
property Items[Index: Integer]: TDDCSNoteItem read GetItem write SetItem;
```
Don't use this.

**VitalsPage**<br/>
Assigning a TTabSheet as the VitalsPage means to embed that tab with the TDDCSVitals frame. The embedded TabSheet must not have any other component on it and only one VitalsPage can exists for any one DDCS Form. If the value is changed the previous page has this Vitals component removed.

---

**Published Events**

---

**OnAccept**<br/>
After "Finish" is clicked and the preview is shown and closed and the ReportItems are saved this event will be called.

**OnFinish**<br/>
This event is called when the "Finish" button is clicked before the preview is shown.

**OnOverrideNote**<br/>
When the note is shown either through "Preview" or "Finish" and after the the ReportItems have been validated, if validation passes then this event will be called to populate the note rather than using the ReportItems to populate the note.

**OnRestore**<br/>
*Currently not active.*

**OnSave**<br/>
This event is called when the user clicks the "Save" button and when the auto save triggers.

---

**Public Properties**

---

**MultiInterface**<br/>
This property (which is also a field in the file #19641.42), when set to YES each page in the configuration will be understood treated as an individual program so that each page can be shown alone (other pages will be hidden). However, multiples pages can still be shown simintanously.

**TmpStrList**<br/>
This property is the TStringList that is populated and sent from TDDCSForm back to the COMObject to be sent over to CPRS. Populate this property only for use of creating an OnOverrideNote method.

**Validated**<br/>
This property is used when the OnOverrideNote method is used, set this property if you are doing your own validation.

**VitalsControl**<br/>
This gives you direct access to the TDDCSVitals component that is embedded into a TTabSheet when the VitalsPage property is set.

**ScreenReader**<br/>
This procedure allows you to associate a sting to a control so that when the control gains focus JAWS will say that string. Use this procedure in the FormCreate event.

**CurrentStyle**<br/>
This property would be used by the menu option via the command menu to change the form style which is currently set to "Default". When this property is set it will pass the style over to DisplayDialog so that the program is visually uniform. However, that dialog must then have that as a resource - see "Adding Themes".

**Configuration**<br/>
This property is another TOwnedCollection like ReportCollection except it is designed to hold large records imported from VistA that can be populated into many controls on the form and then later updated upon completion of the form and passed back to VistA.

---

**Public Procedures**

---

```Pascal
procedure cbAutoWidth(Sender: TObject);
```
This is a helper method that can be assigned to TComboBox.OnDropDown. It will widen the drop down pane to the longest entry in the list.

```Pascal
procedure RadioGroupEnter(Sender: TObject);
```
This is a helper method that can be assigned to TRadioGroup.OnEnter. It will focus the first TRadiobutton on tab entry.

```Pascal
procedure GetPatientAllergies(var oText: TStringList);
```
This method will call VistA to return a text table to report the patient's allergies.

```Pascal
procedure GetPatientActiveProblems(var oText: TStringList);
```
This method will call VistA to return a text table to report the patient's active problems.

```Pascal
procedure GetPatientActiveMedications(var oText: TStringList);
```
This method will call VistA to return a text table to report the patient's active medications.

```Pascal
procedure LoadDialogs;
```
This method will reload the DDCSDialogs.dll which is also accomplished by the user via the command menu.

---

**Public Functions**

---

```Pascal
function HasSecurityKey(const KeyName: string): Boolean;
```
Pass in the security key name and VistA will return True/False whether or not the user running the program has said key.

---

**Method Pointers**

---

```Pascal
DisplayDialog: TDisplayDialog;

			TDisplayDialog = function(const Broker: PCPRSComBroker; dlgName: WideString; DebugMode: Boolean; sTheme: WideString;
																out rSave,rConfig,rText: WideString): WordBool; stdcall;

	    if Assigned(DisplayDialog) then
			  if DisplayDialog(@RPCBrokerV, sBuild, False, CurrentStyle, wSave, wConfig, wText) then
```

DisplayDialog can be called as follows but is used interally for components configured with dialog entries.

```Pascal
GetDialogComponents: TGetDialogComponents;

			TGetDialogComponents = procedure(dlgName: WideString; out Return: WideString); stdcall;

			if Assigned(FDDCSForm.GetDialogComponents) then
      	FDDCSForm.GetDialogComponents(lvDialog.Items[lvDialog.ItemIndex].Caption, wStr);
```

GetDialogComponents can be called as follows but is used internally for the GUI side configuration.

VitalsPage
-------------
The TDDCSVitals frame is embedded in a TTabSheet of a TDDCSForm component. It will show one to three pages and is itself a PageControl.

The following are its pages...

1. **Vitals**</br>
![Vitals Page One](https://github.com/VHAINNOVATIONS/Maternity-Tracker/tree/master/Documentation/VitalsPg1.png)</br>
2. **Estimated Delivery Date**</br>
![Vitals Page Two](https://github.com/VHAINNOVATIONS/Maternity-Tracker/tree/master/Documentation/VitalsPg2.png)</br>
This page is only visible for female patients.</br>
3. **Menstrual History**</br>
![Vitals Page Three](https://github.com/VHAINNOVATIONS/Maternity-Tracker/tree/master/Documentation/VitalsPg3.png)</br>
This page is only visible for female patients.

---

**Public Procedures**

---

```Pascal
procedure Save;
```

This procedure is called when the user clicks the save button located on the command bar or when the form is closed.

```Pascal
procedure GetPatientVitals(var oText: TStringList);
```

This procedure is called when the note for preview is generated to display the first page of the vitals component.

```Pascal
procedure GetEDDNote(var oText: TStringList);
```

This procedure is called when the note for preview is generated to display the second page of the vitals component (only female patients).

```Pascal
procedure GetLMPNote(var oText: TStringList);
```

This procedure is called when the note for preview is generated to display the third page of the vitals component (only female patients).

---

**Public Functions**

---

```Pascal
function GetTextforFocus(Value: TWinControl): string;
```

When the ActiveControl changes (the user has changed focus from one TWinControl to another) this function is called and if it comes back with a string and the ScreenReader (JAWS COMObject) is not nil then the ScreenReader Say method is called with it.

---

**Public Properties**

---

```Pascal
property Vitals: TDDCSVitals ...
```

Direct access to the vitals component if it has been assigned to a TTabSheet.

DDCSDialogs.DLL
==============
The DDCSDialogs.dll is a collection of forms that inherit from TDDCSDialog and they can range from the very simple to the very complex.

Adding a new dialog to this DLL is as simple as...

 1. Add a new VCL Form to the project.
 2. Name your unit with a prefix of "udlg" and your form with a prefix of "dlg".
 3. Right Click the project "DDCSDialogs.dll" and select "View Source". In here add your new form to the RegisterDialogs procedure as follows.
	```Pascal
	RegisterClass(TdlgMyNewDialog);  sl.Add('TdlgMyNewDialog^udlgMyNewDialog');
	```
*If a dialog is not within this RegisterClass procedure then it will not be recognized by TDDCSForm.*

---

**Public Procedures**

---

**SayOnFocus**(wControl: TWinControl; tSay: string);

This procedure allows you to associate a sting to a control so that when the control gains focus JAWS will say that string. Use this procedure in the FormCreate event.

*Example Use*
```Pascal
procedure TdlgMyNewDialog.FormCreate(Sender: TObject);
begin
  SayOnFocus(cbSOBY, 'Shortness of breath?');
  SayOnFocus(cbSOBN, 'Shortness of breath?');
end;
```
*When the user focuses on cbSOBY JAWS will say "Shortness of breath?".*

**BuildSaveList**(var oText: TStringList);

This method is used collect all the values of all the ReportItems (which is all the components for the dialog unless you added code to delete some) which is called in the DisplayDialog method when the dialog is closed and the ModalResult is mrOK to send back to the caller of DisplayDialog as the rSave WideString which (if called by the methods to dislay dialogs from component lists) is saved in VistA as the components discreet data for that dialog for that TDDCSForm for that note.

This TStringList is contrstructed with each line representing a component and if that component has multiple values then it would be duplicated in the list with the value piece updated to reflect the additional entries.

[0]=COMPONENT_NAME^INDEX^VALUE
*If no INDEX then that piece is just left empty. If the component is a TCheckbox or TChecklistbox then the INDEX may also contain the literal TRUE if checked.*

```
| +-- _Note
|     +-- _TDDCSForm
|         +-- Component - Data
|         +-- Component - Data
|         +-- _Dialog
|             +-- Component - Data
|             +-- Component - Data
```

---

**Public Properties**

---

**TmpStrList**<br/>
This property is really the whole point to the dialog. The point of the dialog is to share a common form among DDCS Forms which produce a block of text to be added to the DDCS Form note.

*Example Use*
```Pascal
procedure TdlgMyNewDialog.bbtnOKClick(Sender: TObject);
begin
  if leOnset.Text  <> '' then
	TmpStrList.Add('  Onset: ' + leOnset.Text);
  if cbSOBY.Checked then
	TmpStrList.Add('  Shortness of breath?: Yes');
  if cbSOBN.Checked then
	TmpStrList.Add('  Shortness of breath?: No');
  if leDur.Text  <> '' then
	TmpStrList.Add('  Duration: ' + leDur.Text);
  if leAssocSym.Text  <> '' then
  begin
	TmpStrList.Add('  Associated Symptoms:');
	TmpStrList.Add('    ' + leAssocSym.Text);
  end;

  if TmpStrList.Count > 0 then
	TmpStrList.Insert(0, 'MyNewDialog:');
end;
```

**Configuration**<br/>
This property is another TOwnedCollection like ReportCollection except it is designed to hold large records imported from VistA that can be populated into many controls on the form and then later updated upon completion of the form and passed back to VistA.

*Example*<br/>
The TdlgPregHist utilizes this collection so that it can build many pages of historical pregnancy data. The user is also able to change and add to this data which means that this collection needs to be updated as well.

```Pascal
procedure TdlgPregHist.FormShow(Sender: TObject);
var
  I,G,J,L: Integer;
  vPreg: TfPreg;
  vPregInfo: TfPregInfo;
  vPregChild: TfChild;
  cItem: TConfigItem;
  tmp,btmp,sLkup: string;

  //   2) IEN
  //   3) DATE RECORDED
  //   4) EDC
  //   5) DFN|PATIENT
  //   6) STATUS
  //   7) FOF|(IEN OR IDENTIFIER)
  //   8) EDD
  //   9) PREGNANCY END
  //  10) OB IEN|OB
  //  11) FACILITY IEN|FACILITY
  //  12) UPDATED BY IEN|UPDATED BY

  //  14) LENGTH OF LABOR
  //  15) TYPE OF DELIVERY
  //  16) ANESTHESIA
  //  17) PRETERM DELIVERY
  //  18) BIRTH TYPE
  //  19) IEN;NUMBER;NAME;GENDER;BIRTH WEIGHT;STILLBORN;APGAR1;APGAR2;STATUS;NICU|

**ScreenReader**<br/>
If you need direct access to the screen reader then you have access to it through TDDCSDialog.

*ScreenReader: IJawsApi*
```Pascal
IJawsApi = interface(IDispatch)
['{123DEDB4-2CF6-429C-A2AB-CC809E5516CE}']
	function RunScript(const ScriptName: WideString): WordBool; safecall;
	function SayString(const StringToSpeak: WideString; bFlush: WordBool): WordBool; safecall;
	procedure StopSpeech; safecall;
	function Enable(vbNoDDIHooks: WordBool): WordBool; safecall;
	function Disable: WordBool; safecall;
	function RunFunction(const FunctionName: WideString): WordBool; safecall;
end;
```
*Only SayString is recommend for use - all other methods should be avoided.*

**ReportCollection**<br/>
This is just like the ReportCollection owned by TDDCSForm. When a dialog is created all components are added to the ReportCollection and they are saved to VistA in the same manner as well, so when the dialog is running you may manipulate these ReportItems as you see fit.

Configuring your Form
=====================
Before you are able to run your project you will first have to do some setup to link it to VistA.

**Parameter**
---

The DSIO DDCS LOCATION parameter is required as it and the configuration file needs to be able to build the absolute path that will allow COM to access and open the form dll. In this case if I am accessing the TIU Note Title that is under DDCS control (NURSE POSTPARTUM – MATERNAL) then the oCNT_NursePostpartumMaternal.dll must then be located where the parameter indicates so: C:\Users\USERNAME\Desktop\DDCS\_output\oCNT_NursePostpartumMaternal.dll

*Set the LOCATION parameter to the location of the dlls.*

          Select PARAMETER DEFINITION NAME: DSIO DDCS LOCATION     DSIO DDCS LOCATION

          ------ Setting DSIO DDCS LOCATION for System: ... ------
          LOCATION: C:\Users\USERNAME\Desktop\DDCS\_output\

**Register COMObject**
---

In Windows, open the command prompt as an administrator and navigate to the COM Object that is located on the workstation that is accessing the DDCS Form Templates/oCNTs. Once your terminal is pointing to the same directory in which your COM resides run the command “regsvr32 DDCSFormBuilder.dll” without quotes.

![Image](https://github.com/VHAINNOVATIONS/Maternity-Tracker/tree/master/Documentation/readme_images/COM_regsvr32.png)

If this is your first time using COM Object with CPRS then you may have to also register CPRS. To do this repeat the steps above but navigate to the location of the CPRS executable and run the command "CPRSChart /register" without quotes.

Both of the above commands just need to be run once on each of the machines accessing COM Objects for CPRS. If CPRS is on a server then it needs to be registered there; however, the DDCSFormBuilder.dll needs to be on each machine and registered there.

In order for the COMObject to display a DDCS Form it must have the CONTROL OBJECT in this file - we will be using TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION (8925.1) for our example but it is not limited to TIU Note Titles.

In FileMan use the "ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES" option to edit the "DSIO DDCS CONTROL" (#19641.4) file.

		VA FileMan 22.0

		Select OPTION: 1  ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES

		INPUT TO WHAT FILE: 19641.4  DSIO DDCS CONTROL
		EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL//

**CONTROL OBJECT**: 167;TIU(8925.1,//<br/>
This is the "object" you wish to have extended by this package (DSIO DDCS). Basically, what it comes down to is that you are collecting information and associating it to a record in VistA.

**INACTIVE**:<br/>
Set this field to "YES" if you wish to keep the entry but cease controlling it.

**DESTINATION FILE**: TIU DOCUMENT//<br/>
When you control an "object" you need to identify where the data is being stored so in the case of TIU that's 8925 so the data collected for this control will be associated to a variable pointer that will be "IEN;TIU(8925," where the IEN is created and passed over to DDCS via the GUI.

**PATIENT ORIENTED**: YES//<br/>
This will assist any back end code in retrieving the DFN if needed. In most cases it is and may not work if it cannot obtain a valid DFN. However, if the DESTINATION FILE is not patient oriented there is still an opportunity to provide M code that can obtain it.

**PATIENT FIELD**: .02//<br/>
This is paired up with the DESTINATION FILE if it is PATIENT ORIENTED.

**SHARE**:<br/>
If there is a need to accumulate data then SHARE would be set to "YES" to save all collected data to a patient centric file rather than the record generic one. Setting this field to "LIMITED" will allow some of the collected data to be stored directly under the patient which is handled by the configuration of the Form (#19641.42) or Dialog (#19641.49). An example of this action is having the field set to LIMITED and using the OB Flow Sheet dialog which shows all entries ever collected every time the dialog is opened no matter what note it was collected in.

**FORM**: NURSE POSTPARTUM - MATERNAL//<br/>
This is the form configuration for this controlled object. This entry will also state what program that this control shall execute.

**PATIENT LOOKUP CODE**:<br/>
If this controlled object's DESTINATION FILE is not PATIENT ORIENTED then you would have to supply the M code here that could be executed to retrieve the appropriate DFN.

**TRIGGER LOGIC**: ```I $$GET1^DIQ(DDCSFLE,SIEN_",",.05)="COMPLETED" ```<br/>
DSIO DDCS has an option that can be invoked (DSIO DDCS CHECK STATUS) that will check any entries that have not been "PUSHED" (which is a X-REF in #19641.41 that only exists if an entry has not been "PUSHED") and come back to it's CONTROL entry here and execute this M code to determine if it can "PUSH" the collected data (the collected data is not destroyed upon "PUSH").

**PRE PUSH**: ```N LNK S LNK=$$SPG^DSIO3($G(DFN),SIEN,$$PG^DSIO4($G(DFN))) ```<br/>
M code that is executed if the TRIGGER LOGIC passes but before any further action is taken to "PUSH" the collected data.

**POST PUSH**:<br/>
M code that is executed after the collected data is "PUSHED".

**PACKAGE**: TEXT INTEGRATION UTILITIES//<br/>
Used to identify the package this record is enhancing - also helpful when screening entries for transport.

*At the programmer prompt you can **D ^DSIO61** to be assisted in building a CONTROL entry.*

At the **FORM** you would have created an new entry in DSIO DDCS FORM CONFIGURATION (#19641.42) which now you'll need to edit before you can run your program.

For now, we'll just start with the basics. Upon selecting our entries we need to identify the name of the program we need to run and that's in the FILENAME field. Set this field with the name of your program including the extension.

		VA FileMan 22.0

		Select OPTION: 1  ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES

		INPUT TO WHAT FILE: 19641.42  DSIO DDCS FORM CONFIGURATION
		EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// FILENAME
		THEN EDIT FIELD:

		Select DSIO DDCS FORM CONFIGURATION INTERFACE: NURSE POSTPARTUM - MATERNAL
		  TEXT INTEGRATION UTILITIES
		FILENAME: DDCSNursePostpartumMaternity.dll

If you're setting up DDCS for a TIU Note you can either link it to a title or to be launch as a COMObject. If the latter then you would be launching the DDCSFormBuilder.dll COMObject and then selecting the TIU Note Title you identified in DSIO DDCS CONTROL (#19641.4).

Before running your program you need to first assign yourself the **DSIO DDCS CONFIG** security key so that you can run the GUI side configuration tools.

		Allocation of Security Keys
		De-allocation of Security Keys
		Enter/Edit of Security Keys
		All the Keys a User Needs
		Allocate/De-Allocate Exclusive Key(s)
		Change user's allocated keys to delegated keys
		Delegate keys
		Keys For a Given Menu Tree
		List users holding a certain key
		Remove delegated keys
		Show the keys of a particular user

		Select Key Management Option: ALLOCATION of Security Keys

		Allocate key: DSIO DDCS CONFIG

		Another key:

		Holder of key: TF

		Another holder:

		You've selected the following keys:

		DSIO DDCS CONFIG

		You've selected the following holders:

		TF

		You are allocating keys.  Do you wish to proceed? YES//

Now, you should be able to launch your program and when you do the first thing you need to do is navigate to the Command Menu select the "Edit Configuration" option and run "Update All". Follow the images below...

![Command Menu Button Location](https://github.com/VHAINNOVATIONS/Maternity-Tracker/tree/master/Documentation/readme_images/CommandMenu.png)

![Configuration & Reporting](https://github.com/VHAINNOVATIONS/Maternity-Tracker/tree/master/Documentation/readme_images/ConfigurationUpdateAll.png)

What you just did was to populate your DSIO DDCS FORM CONFIGURATION (#19641.42) entry will all the components controlled by TDDCSForm and the properties set for their associated ReportItem.

Saving Data
===========
When the TDDCSForm saves data it saves it down to DSIO DDCS DATA (#19641.41) under the soft variable pointer that's built from the DSIO DDCS CONTROL (#19641.4) DESTINATION FILE field and the IEN of the entry passed in via the program. All components on your form that have a ReportItem and are not set to DoNotSave = TRUE will exist here as pointers to a record of the object in DSIO DDCS ELEMENT (#19641.45). When the note is saved again these entries are updated.

```
| +-- _Note
|     +-- _TDDCSForm
|         +-- Component - Data
|         +-- Component - Data
|         +-- _Dialog

Option: DSIO DDCS MAIN
----------------------

			Select OPTION NAME: DSIO DDCS MAIN       DDCS MAIN MENU

			          Create CONTROL objects to capture
			          Configure DDCS forms
			          View Discreet Data
			          Run DDCS Control Triggers for PUSH
			          Remove Push Lock

			Select DDCS MAIN MENU Option:

1. Create CONTROL objects to capture</br>
This option will assist in creating an entry in file 19641.4 which will allow for the capture of discreet data.

2. Configure DDCS forms</br>
This option will assist in creating an entry that will act as the configuration for an interface that can capture discreet data.

3. View Discreet Data</br>
This option will display the components associated with a file and record combination and their values.

4. Run DDCS Control Triggers for PUSH</br>
This option will run through any entries in the data collected (#19641.41) among records not already PUSHed, check their control entries (#19641.4) by running the trigger logic and if true, run that data record's configuration (#19641.42 and #19641.49) PUSH which will either be field "PUSH (AS A WHOLE)" (#.04) or each PAGE (#1) CONTROLS (#1) PUSH (#.03).

```
| +-- _DSIO DDCS FORM CONFIGURATION (#19641.42)
|     +-- _PAGE (#1)
|         +-- _CONTROLS (#1)
|             +-- PUSH  (#.03)
```

5. Remove Push Lock</br>
If running the PUSH for discreet data causes a hard error all PUSH will be locked until resolved and this option is run. This option will then remove the lock so that PUSH can resume.

Accessing the Component Data in VistA
-------------------------------------
Each component is represented in VistA as a record in DSIO DDCS ELEMENT (#19641.45) which holds the name of the component, its class, and its values. The values are stored in a word processing field and note that the data can either be a single line like for a TEdit or many lines like a TMemo. Information about the class can be found in the DSIO DDCS CONTROLS (#19641.425) file. The expected format of the VALUE field is that each line will have two pieces with the first piece representing the INDEX and the second piece being the value. Not all controls will use INDEX and some like a TCheckListBox will use it and also include the word TRUE along with the index to indicate that that entry was checked.

You can configure your DSIO DDCS FORM CONFIGRATION to do something with your data once it passes the check to trigger in your DSIO DDCS CONTROL record. This action can be configured to execute a routine or to execute M code for individual components or to generate observations.

Triggering to Run Routines
--------------------------
The configuration file points to the DSIO DDCS REPORT ITEMS (#19641.401) file which can have an item that is used to run code when the whole interface is triggered to be pushed or when a single component is pushed. In the case of single compoents each component of an interface can have its own push logic or none at all.

```
| +-- _DSIO DDCS FORM CONFIGURATION  (#19641.42)
|     +-- _PUSH (AS A WHOLE) (#.04) = P19641.401
```

```
 #19641.401
 --------------------------
 .01       NAME
 .02       INACTIVE
 1         INPUT TRANSFORM
 2         RUN ROUTINE
```

When writing a routine (or sub rotuine) for PUSH you can expect the following variables...

Variable    | What it is       
----------- | ----------------
**DDCSC**   | CONTROL
**DDCSR**   | RECORD

Transfering Data from one form to Retore to Another
---------------------------------------------------
The example use of this functionality is while using TIU Notes. You can set up the DSIO DDCS CONTROL (#19641.4) to control three different note titles that each have their own configuration (DSIO DDCS FORM CONFIGURATION #19641.42) which each call up the same FILENAME (#.05). In this case you can have all three records with the same starting values but two entries can restore (RESTORE AS #.06) from the configuration (pointer back to #19641.42) of another.

```
  #Note 1 = RESTORE AS = ""
	#Note 2 = RESTORE AS = #Note 1
	#Note 3 = RESTORE AS = #Note 2
```

Since each note is using the same program and the same configuration this means that it can restore the data elements of its current configuration by pulling in the values saved to the same components using the configuration set as RESTORE AS.

```
  #Note 1 = COMPONENT1 = "Test Text" (Saved and Completed)
	#Note 2 = COMPONENT1 = "Test Text" (Start Up/Creation - Get values to components matching components in #Note 1)
	#Note 3 = COMPONENT1 = "Test Text" (Start Up/Creation - Get values to components matching components in #Note 2)
```
*If you change the value of COMPONENT1 in #Note 2 save and complete then that value will be restored in #Note 3.*
